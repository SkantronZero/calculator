# Calculator Project for the Odin Project

## Welcome to the SI-105

### My experience when creating this -

This calculator will only act as a One Line calculator. This actually made it a bit more difficult logic wise, rather than just collecting a large string/array then mapping / filtering / reducing. The reason for this is that the display needs to stay isolated to the latest number entry and does not show the expressed operation.


### Areas for improvement.

For improvements, I would like to find a cleaner way of initializing all of the buttons and other elements. I'd also like to understand why the numbers move slightly when clicked.
